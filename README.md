# echo-application

Project completed for Computer Networks course CS 455 in Fall 2023. The assignment was to implement a client - server application that sent messages using socket programming.
The actual content of the messages are arbitrary since the goal is only to record the RTT and Throughput measurements. The size of the messages is the only thing that is important to this project.
All code written was done by myself, none of it was provided as skeleton code, as the implementation was left up to us to decide.
Follow the README files for each .java file for details on how to configure/run locally, and the PDF is the report and documentation written as part of the assignment.
